# Turtle-Graphics-3000
Python's unique "batteries included" philosophy includes support for creating some extremely interesting graphics.

No longer three (3) separate opportunities, I've never seen a more [comprehensive coverage](https://www.udemy.com/course/introduction-to-turtle-graphics/?referralCode=640D3C0F33837ADAE793) of Python's Turtle Graphics module!

Starting out, here is the complete source code and examples for my "Python 3000 - Turtle Graphics" educational 'op.

# The Channel
Part of a new [Total Pythoneering Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TotalPythoneering) my entire set of lessons (Python 3000 "Cartesian Planes & Plotting", Python 4000 "Graphical Planes and Plotting for Pythoneers", and Python 5000 "Cartesian Frameworks") have been combined into a [single educational opportunity](https://www.udemy.com/course/introduction-to-turtle-graphics/?referralCode=640D3C0F33837ADAE793).

# The Playlsit
This repo shares that '3000 set of support code (examples as well as lab exercises.) The first 4 of the new 10 hour of training the **Python 3000** playlist is being release [here](https://youtu.be/trtr0Fv97jM?si=qBP_SVgeY1rJX2UU). Every *Friday @5AM EST.*

Here is [the how-to video](https://youtu.be/fARxiPCnfzA?si=4id9dZ0kjPtOdIgP).
